# FEP

FEP stands for "Far East Project." This repository contains a simple text-based
life simulation game set in a far-future Seoul. All in-game text is in Korean.

## Running the Game

```bash
python game.py
```

During the game you will be prompted in Korean to choose actions such as working, eating, sleeping, or exploring. Manage your character's stats and survive as long as possible.
