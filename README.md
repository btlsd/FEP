# FEP

FEP stands for "Far East Project." This repository contains a simple text-based
life simulation game set in a far-future Seoul and beyond. All in-game text is in Korean.

## Running the Game

```bash
python game.py
```

During the game you will be prompted in Korean to choose actions such as working, eating, sleeping, exploring, or traveling between nations. The world contains several distinct countries: a human-focused nation, a large ecological federation of many species, an offline machine state, and an online machine network. Manage your character's stats and survive as long as possible while visiting these places.
